It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as:\n\n\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor."

The only difference between “value” and “manual” is the default value for mapping.\nThe “value” treemap considers palette to be a diverging color palette (say ColorBrewer’s “RdYlBu”), and maps it in such a way that 0 corresponds to the middle color (typically white or yellow), -max(abs(values)) to the left-end color, and max(abs(values)), to the right-end color.\nThe “manual” treemap simply maps min(values) to the left-end color, max(values) to the right-end color, and mean(range(values)) to the middle color.\n\n\n\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"value\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Although the colour palette used is RdYlBu but there are no red rectangles in the treemap above. This is because all the median unit prices are positive.\nThe reason why we see only 5000 to 45000 in the legend is because the range argument is by default c(min(values, max(values)) with some pretty rounding.\n\n\n\nThe value range is mapped linearly to the colour palette.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\nThe diverging colour scheme used is confusing because mapping = (min(values), mean(range(values)), max(values)).\nA single colour palette such as “Blues” should be used.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreemap() supports two popular treemap layouts, “squarified” and “pivotSize” (default).\n\n\n\nThe squarified treemap algorithm (Bruls et al., 2000) produces good aspect ratios, but ignores the sorting order of the rectangles (sortID).\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"squarified\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ordered treemap, pivot-by-size, algorithm (Bederson et al., 2002) takes the sorting order (sortID) into account while aspect ratios are still acceptable.\nsortID argument can be used to dertemine the order in which the rectangles are placed from top left to bottom right.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"pivotSize\",\n        sortID = \"Median Transacted Price\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=realis2018_selected, \n       aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`,\n           fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`),\n       layout = \"scol\",\n       start = \"bottomleft\") + \n  geom_treemap() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"light blue\", high = \"blue\")\n\nWarning in fortify(data, ...): Arguments in `...` must be used.\n✖ Problematic arguments:\n• layout = \"scol\"\n• start = \"bottomleft\"\nℹ Did you misspell an argument name?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=realis2018_selected, \n       aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`,\n           fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`,\n           subgroup = `Planning Region`),\n       start = \"topleft\") + \n  geom_treemap()\n\nWarning in fortify(data, ...): Arguments in `...` must be used.\n✖ Problematic argument:\n• start = \"topleft\"\nℹ Did you misspell an argument name?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=realis2018_selected, \n       aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`,\n           fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`,\n           subgroup = `Planning Region`,\n           subgroup2 = `Planning Area`)) + \n  geom_treemap()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=realis2018_selected, \n       aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`,\n           fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`,\n           subgroup = `Planning Region`,\n           subgroup2 = `Planning Area`)) + \n  geom_treemap() +\n  geom_treemap_subgroup2_border(colour = \"gray40\",\n                                size = 2) +\n  geom_treemap_subgroup_border(colour = \"gray20\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(d3treeR)\n\n\n\n\ntreemap() is used to build a treemap by using selected variables in condominium data.frame.

This is because all the median unit prices are positive.\nThe reason why we see only 5000 to 45000 in the legend is because the range argument is by default c(min(values, max(values)) with some pretty rounding.\n\n\n\nThe value range is mapped linearly to the colour palette.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\nThe diverging colour scheme used is confusing because mapping = (min(values), mean(range(values)), max(values)).\nA single colour palette such as “Blues” should be used.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreemap() supports two popular treemap layouts, “squarified” and “pivotSize” (default).\n\n\n\nThe squarified treemap algorithm (Bruls et al., 2000) produces good aspect ratios, but ignores the sorting order of the rectangles (sortID).\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"squarified\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ordered treemap, pivot-by-size, algorithm (Bederson et al., 2002) takes the sorting order (sortID) into account while aspect ratios are still acceptable.\nsortID argument can be used to dertemine the order in which the rectangles are placed from top left to bottom right.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"pivotSize\",\n        sortID = \"Median Transacted Price\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )"
